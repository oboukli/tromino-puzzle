This is a C library implementing a divide-and-conquer O(n) algorithm, and a
collection of apps, to solve the tromino puzzle, over-engineered for the joy of
learning by doing.

A tromino puzzle consists of a checkered 2^n √ó 2^n (chess-like) board, where
exactly one of the board's squares is marked. The goal is to tile the entire
board, except for the marked square, with L-shaped tiles. A tile is a right
tromino, in the shape of an L formed by three board squares. Each tile has four
possible rotations.

## Background

The developer (@oboukli) was first introduced to the tromino puzzle in early
2006, via Anany Levitin's book _Introduction to the Design and Analysis of
Algorithms_, published in 2003 by Addison-Wesley. Anany Levitin mentions Solomon
W. Golomb's second edition _Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and
Packings_, published in 1994 by Princeton University Press, as a reference to the
puzzle.

The realization of the recursive solution was such a beautiful epiphany to the
developer.

## Building the web app

The web app makes use of WebAssembly and requires Emscripten to build.

```shell
cd emscripten
emmake make
```

### Building and running the web app on Docker

To build the web app:

```shell
docker pull emscripten/emsdk
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -v $(pwd)/emscripten_cache:/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/cache --workdir="/src/emscripten" emscripten/emsdk emmake make -j 3
```

To run the web app:

```shell
docker pull nginx
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/dist/web:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro --name tromino-puzzle nginx
```

## Building the command line app

### Virtual terminal mode

The virtual terminal (VT-100) mode should work on any system with POSIX
support, including supported versions of macOS and Windows.

For basic ASCII drawings, which may be useful for writing to text files,
define `TROMINO_USE_ASCII` before building.

### Windows Console Host mode

On Windows, a native legacy Windows Console Host (WCH) renderer, which uses DOS
box-drawing characters
([code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437)), is included.

## Building the desktop app

The desktop app is currently supported on macOS. See the `xcode` directory for
the Xcode project files.

For Windows and Linux, no build files are provided but it should be possible
to build for the said platforms without source code modification.

The SDL2 library is required to build the desktop app.
